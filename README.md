10/20/2020: Learned a lot on this project, but there are also many things that I wanted to do but decided that I would have to figure it out later, for the sake of not losing momentum with the curriculum. Hoping to come back to this project to make the user experience smoother with the color picker changes, make the crayonEffect consistent (at this point, if you switch back and forth between colorWells and the rainbow magic marker effect, you lose the shading effect; all coloring becomes opaque), and add a Screenshot feature.
